**Data Professional Survey Breakdown** 

This project analyzes the results of a public survey conducted by **Alex The Analyst**, which collected responses from current and aspiring professionals across various data roles (Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, etc.).

The goal of the project is to better understand the landscape of data-related careers by breaking down key topics such as:
- **Average salary by job title**
- **How difficult it is to break into tech**
- **Levels of satisfaction with work/life balance**
- **Most popular / favorite programming languages**

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – cleaning, modeling, and visualization  
- **Power Query** – handling transformations (split, replace values, custom columns)

## 🛠️ Key Steps Performed

| Step | Description |
|------|------------|
| 1 | Removed columns that were not significant to the analysis |
| 2 | Cleaned the **Job Title** field (some values were listed as “Others(Accountant)” → split by delimiter to extract the actual role) |
| 3 | Cleaned and transformed the **Salary** column (values provided as ranges, e.g. “105k-120k”) |
| 4 | Replaced values and created a **custom column** to compute the average salary |
| 5 | Built dashboards to analyze salary averages, perceived difficulty of getting into tech, work/life balance satisfaction, and preferred programming languages |
